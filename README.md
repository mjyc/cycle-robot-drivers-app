# cycle-robot-drivers-starter

A starter pkg for building [cycle-robot-drivers](https://github.com/mjyc/cycle-robot-drivers) apps.

## Getting started

You should use this repo as follows:

1. Fork this repo on github and start hacking
2. Import this (or forked) repo into stackblitz by browsing to `https://stackblitz.com/github/{your_github_id}/cycle-robot-drivers-app`
3. Import this (or forked) repo into [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io) by browsing to `https://codesandbox.io/s/github` an fill in the first box with `https://github.com/{your_github_id}/cycle-robot-drivers-app`

### Note

To make this repo import-able by both [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/docs#import-from-github) and [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing#import-from-github) asap, this package is dependent on `react*` pkgs and using `react-script` to run a [Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org) app, which I find a bit weird.
There maybe a way to get rid of `react*` dependencies while remaining import-able by stackblitz and codesandbox--if you know how to do this, let me know!
